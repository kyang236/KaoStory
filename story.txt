  Earth, Water, Fire, Air. Long ago the four nation lived in harmony until the 
Fire nation attack. The avatar, master of all four element vanished when the
the world needed him most. A hundred years past and my brother and I discovered a new avatar named Aang. Though his airbending skills were great, he still had a lot to learn before he was ready to save anyone. But I believe that Aang can save the world.
