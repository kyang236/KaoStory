  Earth, Water, Fire, Air. Long ago the four nation lived in harmony until the 
Fire nation attack. The avatar, master of all four element vanished when the
the world needed him most.
 A hundred years past and my brother and I discovered a new avatar named Aang. Though his airbending skills were great, he still had a lot to learn before he was ready to save anyone. But I believe that Aang can save the world.
 Now in present day, my brother and I went off to gather food and we saw this
huge frozen ice ball. Inside the ice ball is a child who seem to have
airbending tatoos. Then suddenly, his tatoos started to glow and everything 
went blank and the world is safe now because that was the avatar.
